  This example is based on the GD32H77EI-EVAL-V1.0 board, it shows how to use the ADC to 
convert analog signal to digital data.The ADC is configured in dependent mode, channel17
(VBAT/4 channel), inner channel18(temperature sensor channel),channel21(VREFINT channel) 
and inner channel20(high precision temperature sensor channel),are chosen as analog input pin.

  As the AD conversion begins by software,the converted data in the ADC_IDTRx register.

  We can watch temperature, vref_value and vbat_value in debug mode or by COM.
